Certified Scrum Product Owner

Though each CSPO course varies depending on the instructor, all Certified Scrum Product Owner courses focus on Scrum from a product owner's perspective. Graduates will receive the CSPO designation. All CSPO course are taught by Certified Scrum Trainers.

This unique Product Owner certification course teaches you the basics of running a project using Scrum. You'll learn that You're the Boss, and that you're in command — yet your team is in control. You'll learn the balance of power and governance between the Product Owner, the Team, and the ScrumMaster that make Scrum an effective framework for achieving business goals.

Because You're the Boss, you build this course yourself from a product backlog that's already been estimated by the team (the course instructor). You'll learn right away the importance of choosing must-haves for the market, of honoring dependencies between Product Backlog Items (PBIs), and of getting the most value for your time — all in the first half hour! How it proceeds from there is your choice. Choose from topics in areas such as:

Intro to Scrum

The product backlog

Product Owner Team

The Process

Business Concepts

The Product Owner in the Organization

... or create your own! 

See the Agenda below for more information.

We'll also go in-depth to cover User Stories, traditional requirements, features, Use Cases, and issues, and their strengths and weaknesses as PBIs. We'll take a broad, all-encompassing look at ROI, and look at Agile Contracts: change for free and money for nothing!
