This is James O. Coplien's Scrum Patterns and other his documents.
Translations have done using OmegaT, so this directory structure is same as OmegaT. 


  - source : Original (English) text files
  - target : translated (Japanese) text files
             OmegaT generates Japanese file SJIS encoding, I converted to UTF-8

Please feel free to send me your better translations.
